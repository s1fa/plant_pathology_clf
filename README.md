### Description

#### Problem Statement

Apples are one of the most important temperate fruit crops in the world. Foliar (leaf) diseases pose a major threat to the overall productivity and quality of apple orchards. The current process for disease diagnosis in apple orchards is based on manual scouting by humans, which is time-consuming and expensive.

Although computer vision-based models have shown promise for plant disease identification, there are some limitations that need to be addressed. Large variations in visual symptoms of a single disease across different apple cultivars, or new varieties that originated under cultivation, are major challenges for computer vision-based disease identification. These variations arise from differences in natural and image capturing environments, for example, leaf color and leaf morphology, the age of infected tissues, non-uniform image background, and different light illumination during imaging etc.

Plant Pathology 2020-FGVC7 challenge competition had a pilot dataset of 3,651 RGB images of foliar disease of apples. For Plant Pathology 2021-FGVC8, we have significantly increased the number of foliar disease images and added additional disease categories. This year‚Äôs dataset contains approximately 23,000 high-quality RGB images of apple foliar diseases, including a large expert-annotated disease dataset. This dataset reflects real field scenarios by representing non-homogeneous backgrounds of leaf images taken at different maturity stages and at different times of day under different focal camera settings.

#### Specific Objectives

The main objective of the competition is to develop machine learning-based models to accurately classify a given leaf image from the test dataset to a particular disease category, and to identify an individual disease from multiple disease symptoms on a single leaf image.

ds = datasets.load_from_disk("Path/to/save")

from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("parquet", data_files={'train': 'train.parquet', 'test': 'test.parquet'})

from torchvision.transforms import Compose, ColorJitter, ToTensor

jitter = Compose(
    [ColorJitter(brightness=0.5, hue=0.5), ToTensor()]
)

def transforms(examples):
    examples["pixel_values"] = [jitter(image.convert("RGB")) for image in examples["image"]]
    return examples

dataset = dataset.with_transform(transforms)
```
