## Description
Dataset from the Plant Pathology 2021 (FGVC8) Challenge.

'
For Plant Pathology 2021-FGVC8, we have significantly increased the number of foliar disease images and added additional disease categories. This yearâ€™s dataset contains approximately 23,000 high-quality RGB images of apple foliar diseases, including a large expert-annotated disease dataset. This dataset reflects real field scenarios by representing non-homogeneous backgrounds of leaf images taken at different maturity stages and at different times of day under different focal camera settings.
'

The original dataset has one train split and a test split that was hidden for the challenge. I have taken 10% of train for a validation, using stratified sampling. I do not have access to the test samples.

## Usage
This dataset is serving as a canonical example for multi-label image classificatino datasets with `timm`. The additions to train & val scripts for this are a WIP...
